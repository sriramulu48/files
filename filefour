Announces Dividend Of $0.35 Per Share For Second Quarter

MEDFORD, Ore., July 21, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Lithia & Driveway (NYSE: LAD) today reported the highest second quarter revenue and earnings per share in company history.


Second quarter 2021 revenue increased 118% to $6.0 billion from $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2020.

Second quarter 2021 net income per diluted share was $10.75, a 218% increase from $3.38 per diluted share reported in the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted second quarter 2021 net income per diluted share was $11.12, an 199% increase compared to adjusted net income of $3.72 per diluted share in the same period of 2020.

Second quarter 2021 net income was $305 million, a 292% increase compared to net income of $78 million in the same period of 2020. Adjusted second quarter 2021 net income was $315 million, a 269% increase compared to adjusted net income of $86 million for the same period of 2020.

As shown in the attached non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the 2021 second quarter adjusted results exclude a $0.37 per diluted share net non-core charge related to acquisition expenses, net loss on sale of stores, and insurance reserves, partially offset by a a non-cash unrealized investment gain. The 2020 second quarter adjusted results exclude a $0.34 per diluted share net non-core charge due to asset impairment, insurance reserves, and acquisition expenses, partially offset by a net gain on sale of stores and a tax attribute.

Second Quarter-over-Quarter Comparisons and Operating Highlights:

Total company revenues increased 117.8%
New vehicle retail sales increased 130.0%
Used vehicle retail sales increased 95.7%

Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of gross profit improved by 900 basis points from 64.7% to 55.7%
"Our team's high performance, alongside the robust, demand-driven retail environment in the second quarter, resulted in same store revenue growth of 20% for new vehicles, 49% for used vehicles, 39% for F&I and 3% for service, body and parts compared to 2019," said Bryan DeBoer, Lithia & Driveway, President and CEO. "We achieved our initial Driveway monthly volume milestone in the final month of the quarter and are on pace to reach our target of 15,000 Driveway transactions this year. Combined with our outpaced growth in our core business and network development, we are considerably ahead of our year one goals laid out in our 5-Year Plan announced in July 2020."


For the first six months of 2021 revenues increased 86% to $10.4 billion, compared to $5.6 billion in 2020.

Net income for the first six months of 2021 was $16.69 per diluted share, compared to $5.32 per diluted share in 2020, an increase of 214%. Adjusted net income per diluted share for the first six months of 2021 increased 201% to $17.15 from $5.70 in the same period of 2020.


Corporate Development
During the quarter, we completed numerous acquisitions that in total are expected to contribute $3.7 billion in annualized revenue. These acquisitions strategically added density in key geographic markets and increased our nationwide footprint.

"With 40% of our targeted $20 billion revenue acquired in the first year of our 5-Year Plan, we are well ahead of schedule and are only getting started," said DeBoer. "Our acquisition pipeline is more active than we have ever seen and we are well positioned to continue to aggressively pursue our goal of achieving $50 billion in revenue and $50 of earnings per share."

Balance Sheet Update
We ended the second quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and availability on our revolving lines of credit. In addition, our unfinanced real estate could provide additional liquidity of approximately $655 million.

Dividend Payment
Our Board of Directors approved a dividend of $0.35 per share related to second quarter 2021 financial results. We expect to pay the dividend on August 27, 2021 to shareholders of record on August 13, 2021.

Anticipated impacts of the continued COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. and local economies in which we operate, our business operations and consumer demand;
Continuation of our sales and services, including in-store appointments and home deliveries;
Expected growth from our e-commerce home solutions and digital strategies;

Statements regarding furloughed employees and cost reductions;
Expectations regarding programs and initiatives for employee recruitment, training, and retention; and
Our strategies for customer retention, growth, market position, financial results and risk management.
Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements in this presentation. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimated or projected results include, without limitation:

Future economic and financial conditions (both nationally and locally), including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;
Changes in customer demand, our relationship with, and the financial and operational stability of, vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers;
Risks associated with our indebtedness (including available borrowing capacity, compliance with financial covenants and ability to refinance or repay indebtedness on favorable terms);
The adequacy of our cash flow and earnings and other conditions which may affect our ability to pay our quarterly dividend at the planned level;
Disruptions to our technology network including computer systems and software, as well as natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes or man-made or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures, facilities or equipment; and
Government regulations and legislation, and other risks set forth throughout "Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in "Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in "Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and from time to time in our other filings with the SEC.
Any forward-looking statement made by us in this presentation is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
This presentation contains non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share, adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue and gross profit, adjusted operating margin, adjusted operating profit as a percentage of revenue and gross profit, adjusted pre-tax margin and net profit margin, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, leveraged EBITDA and adjusted total debt. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, we review any non-GAAP financial measures in connection with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We caution you not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. We present cash flows from operations in the attached tables, adjusted to include the change in non-trade floor plan debt to improve the visibility of cash flows related to vehicle financing. As required by SEC rules, we have reconciled these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the attachments to this release. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures we present improve the transparency of our disclosures; provide a meaningful presentation of our results from core business operations, because they exclude items not related to core business operations and other non-cash items; and improve the period-to-period comparability of our results from core business operations. These presentations should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measures.
